# Architecture Samples

Some of the stuff I did to verify and test the architecture implementations.

## Note

Architecture is very fluid and there are many ways to achieve similar results. These
samples are only based on what I thought off at that point in time. Some samples may
be overly simplistic but they serve as a starter guide.

## Samples

**Layered**                - Some small samples to illustrate Layered Architecture.
1. **Api-Without-DI**      - Traditional layered Web Api sample in .net 4.x without Dependency Injection
2. **Api-With-DI**         - Layered Web Api sample in .net core/.net 5. with Dependency Injection
3. **Modern.Naming.Api**   - Suggested modernization of naming convention fot layered components.
